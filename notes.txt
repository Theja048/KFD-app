 we have create dynamic by using
 props => we can pass to the components dynamically through props
 (passing an arguments into a function)

 {

//{resName,cuisine}  ==> (props)  =>valid

// here weve hardcoded to make restaurants call 1 by one 
//but we have used map to iterate in functional way
//key must be unique while using map  (not recommend index)

 }                               
 

 CONFIG DRIVEN UI => basically controlling our UI (api data comes from backend)
 we've  CloudinaryImagesId  which uses CDN hosted RestaurantImages

 two types of export and import 
  default export and named export
  1)
   export default filename

   import filename from "your path"
   2)
   export filename ex( export API_URL)

   hooks: normal javascript functions given us by react that func has
   super powers
   2imp hooks: useState and useEffect
   used to create state variable 
   using useState we can modify UI automatically  render()
   state variable updates react re renders the components...
   using that we have done filter method modfication to our app top rated restaurants
